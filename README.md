# Spigot (or Any) Server Manager

This software was created to manage a Spigot Minecraft server (because I needed to replace myself).

I believe the software could be used to run any commands/scripts on any Linux server by setting some configuration fields as needed. However, it was built with Spigot management in mind. 

The application is more thoroughly explained [in this blog post](https://www.anthonymorast.com/blog/2019/10/19/conveniently-managing-a-linux-spigot-server-or-any-linux-server-really-from-windows/).
